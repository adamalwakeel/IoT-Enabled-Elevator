### In this article Connection between Arduino Nano, Feather HUZZAH ESP8266, and IoT Hub.

 ## What you do Connect Adafruit Feather HUZZAH ESP8266 to an IoT hub that you create. Then you run a sample application on ESP8266 The elevator send message to Azure IOT hub which floor now in real time!! . Finally, you send the message to your IoT hub. 


 ### MQTT Protocol

 In this tutorial we’re going to establish a communication between a Adafruit Feather HUZZAH ESP8266 and an Azure IoT hub  using MQTT.

 MQTT stands for MQ Telemetry Transport and it is a nice lightweight publish and subscribe system where you can publish and receive messages as a client. It is a simple messaging protocol, designed for constrained devices and with low-bandwidth. So, it’s the perfect solution for Internet of Things applications.
